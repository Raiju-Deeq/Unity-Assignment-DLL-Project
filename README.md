# Unity Assignment DLL Project

For this module I was tasked with creating a managed plug in DLL (Dynamic Link Library) that can be integrated into a Unity project. The DLL should handle spawning collectibles, spawning enemies, a scoring system and a game manager.

Then I was tasked with creating a tech demo Unity project that showcased the DLL and had its own separate criteria for the project. I was given a UML class diagram that I had ti implement at the bare minimum and then expand upon the UML class diagram. This repo is the Unity project.
